# fjl-input-filter (ALPHA)
Input filter validation functions (allows
you to easily validate a body of input fields
with a set of rules quickly and easily).

## Usage:
**Note**: Even though there are constructors
for data objects, if you decide to use them directly (via `new ...`)
you should try to use them compositionally and
not extend them.  This will keep your code more functional (or more on the functional side).
